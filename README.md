# Answers

In designing software, I approach it systematically, beginning with a clear definition of the problem and user requirements. I consider modularity, scalability, and maintainability, creating high-level designs before diving into detailed implementation. The 3D graphics project reinforced my design skills, particularly in the realm of graphics programming, teaching me to manage complex systems of objects and their interactions within a scene.

Throughout the project, I adhered to an iterative design process, starting with simple shapes and gradually adding features like lighting and texture. This iterative process is a powerful tactic that I plan to apply in future work, allowing for continuous refinement and integration of feedback.

Developing programs is an evolutionary process for me. I start with a prototype, then refine and optimize. Working on the 3D scene, I implemented new strategies such as scene graphing and shaders. Iteration was key, as I constantly refined the rendering based on visual feedback. The milestones of the project pushed my code development, each iteration adding complexity and leading to a more robust application.

Computer science is a tool that empowers me to achieve my goals by providing a foundation for problem-solving and logical thinking. Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with skills in data representation and user interface design, which are critical in both educational and professional pathways. They allow for complex abstract concepts to be visualized, making them easier to understand and manipulate, which is invaluable in any field that benefits from visual data analysis or digital content creation.

# Features
Interactive camera movement (WASD for movement, mouse for look around)
Dynamic spot and key lighting with controllable position and color
Perspective and orthographic projection toggles
Textured objects with support for different image formats
Real-time rendering with support for window resizing and fullscreen mode

# Dependencies
GLFW 3.3
GLEW 2.1.0
GLM 0.9.9
STB_Image for texture loading

# Building the Project
To build the project, ensure you have the above dependencies installed and use the provided FinalProject.sln solution file for Visual Studio. Otherwise, header files and texture files can be found in code base. Provision your Visual Studio environment to include OPENGL blm, GLAD, GLEW, and GLFW. OpenGL files will be uploaded for assistance.

# Running the Project
Execute the compiled binary, which will open a window displaying the 3D scene. Use the mouse and keyboard to interact with the scene.

# Controls
Escape key to exit the application
Arrow keys to toggle between filled and wireframe rendering
JIKLUO keys to control the spot light position
123 keys to control the key light color
Brackets [ ] to toggle key light on and off
V/B to switch between perspective and orthographic views
