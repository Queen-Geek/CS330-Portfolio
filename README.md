Dynamic spot and key lighting with controllable position and color
Perspective and orthographic projection toggles
Textured objects with support for different image formats
Real-time rendering with support for window resizing and fullscreen mode
Dependencies
GLFW 3.3
GLEW 2.1.0
GLM 0.9.9
STB_Image for texture loading
Building the Project
To build the project, ensure you have the above dependencies installed and use the provided FinalProject.sln solution file for Visual Studio.
